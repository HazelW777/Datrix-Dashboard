# E-commerce Dataset

This folder contains the real e-commerce CSV files for the Datrix Dashboard demo.

## Expected Files:

Please place your 7 CSV files in this directory. The system will automatically detect and parse them.

## File Structure:

- Each CSV file should have a header row with column names
- Data types will be automatically inferred
- Files will be integrated into the workflow interface

## Next Steps:

1. Copy your 7 CSV files into this folder
2. The system will automatically parse and integrate them
3. All existing functionality (cleaning, modeling, inspection) will work with your real data
